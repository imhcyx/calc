# calc
A command-line arithmetic calculator

This simple calculator originally written in 2017 demostrates the process of lexical analysis, syntax analysis and interpreting execution by calculationg an arithmetic formula into the corresponding result. Currently integer literals, binary operators + - * / and bracket expressions are supported (unary + - are implemented in an inelegant way though).

Note: The code is still incomplete in some ways and further improvementts are needed.
